/**
 * Ad-hoc sign macOS builds when no real signing identity is configured.
 *
 * Without any signature at all, macOS refuses a downloaded .app outright with
 * "the application is damaged and can't be opened" — a dead end that only
 * offers to move it to the Trash. Apple Silicon additionally requires every
 * binary to carry *some* valid signature just to execute.
 *
 * An ad-hoc signature (`--sign -`) fixes both: the app becomes runnable, and
 * Gatekeeper downgrades to the ordinary "Apple could not verify this app is
 * free of malware" prompt, which the user can get past via Open Anyway in
 * System Settings. It is not a substitute for notarization — that needs a
 * Developer ID — it just turns an unopenable download into an openable one.
 *
 * `--options runtime` turns on hardened runtime, which camera/mic access
 * needs even outside App Sandbox — but hardened runtime's own entitlements
 * split into two classes. Plain ones (JIT, outbound network) an ad-hoc
 * signature can declare freely. Camera, mic, Bluetooth and keychain-access-
 * groups are AMFI "restricted" entitlements: the kernel refuses to even
 * launch a binary that declares them without a real Apple-issued identity
 * behind it ("The file is adhoc signed but contains restricted entitlements",
 * confirmed via `log show` against amfid). So this ad-hoc path gets hardened
 * runtime plus only the non-restricted entitlements — camera/mic/Bluetooth
 * stay unentitled here, same as before this file started passing
 * `--options runtime` at all. A real Developer ID build (electron-builder's
 * own signing path, once CI secrets exist) gets the full entitlements.mac
 * .plist instead, where those keys work as intended.
